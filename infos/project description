My master's thesis will focus on the ways in which japanese women participated to the digital feminist campaign
#meToo and will attempt to determine whether this participation had a positive impact on feminist movement and
activism against sexual violence in Japan.


We would like to extract messages containing #meToo hashtags posted in Japan from October 2017 to October 2018,
in order to analyze the main themes and categories, and derive a sociological analysis of these tweets.
The data will be treated anonymously, and will not be published as this is a Master's thesis.

The data will be categorize in two large groups, to isolate the testimonies of sexual violence, and the rest
of the data. The goal is to aggregate a corpus of testimonies of personal experiences, on which we will
conduct some lexical and speech analysis.
